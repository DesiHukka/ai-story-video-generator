The Lost Artifact
Ethan Carter, a young archaeologist, stood before the entrance of an ancient temple hidden deep within the Amazon jungle. Legends spoke of a powerful artifact buried within, but many who sought it never returned.

As he stepped inside, the flickering torchlight revealed intricate carvings on the walls, depicting warriors and mystical creatures. Suddenly, a deep voice echoed through the chamber.

"Who dares disturb the temple of the ancients?"

Ethan froze. A shadow emerged from the darknessâ€”an old guardian, clad in ceremonial armor.

"I seek the artifact of Aztaroth," Ethan declared boldly.

The guardian studied him for a moment before speaking. "Only those with a pure heart may proceed. Solve the riddle, or be trapped here forever."

Ethan took a deep breath as ancient symbols on the wall began to glow. The test had begun.
